                        At that time, Kuala Kubu became the gateway to Negeri Pahang. Due to the great flood that hit, the British 
                        moved their administrative center to Kuala Kubu Bharu on May 6, 1931.</td>

                        <strong>making changes in the areas</strong> under its care, <strong>especially Kuala Kubu Bharu</strong>. Many changes and modifications 
                        have been made over time for the comfort and convenience of the residents. The formerly quiet town of Kuala 
                        Kubu Bharu has now changed into a cheerful, clean and beautiful town with a refreshing landscape. On <strong>January 
                        15, 1994</strong>, the <strong>Administrative Office of the Hulu Selangor District Council</strong> which used to be located in the 
                        former Pasar Lama in Kuala Kubu Bharu town was also <strong>moved</strong> to a more spacious and comfortable area. The 
                        office located <strong>on Jalan Bukit Kerajaan</strong> was inaugurated <strong>by Y.A.B Tan Sri Haji Muhammad Haji Muhd Taib, 
                        Selangor Menteri Besar</strong> at that time.</td>
